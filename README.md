# JOCA Turtle Party Project
Progress through 5+ hours of Joy of Coding introductory challenge
by Diana Shannon 

This is the first coding project I undertook post-marriage on May 4, 2024. It's the first time I've seen or used Python Turtle via trinket.io.

Issues: 
* had to go between trinket.io and trinket.io/features/python3 to make every step work
* could not figure out how to change turtle colors within iterations

Fun:
* accidentally created a star, which helped me understand loops a bit better
